## Tsunami-Solver: Tsunami Modeling with the 2D Shallow Water Equations

* A __C++17 Finite Element Solver__ for modeling __Tsunami__ generation and propagation using the __Nonlinear 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE)__. 
---
### Overview

* __Tsunamis__ are __Long-Wavelength__, __High-Energy Waves__ caused by __underwater disturbances__ such as __Earthquakes__, __Landslides__, or __Volcanic Eruptions__.
* This project simulates __Tsunami Wave propagation__ in __coastal__ and __open-ocean__ settings using the __2D Nonlinear Shallow Water Equations__.
