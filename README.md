## Tsunami-Solver: Tsunami Modeling with 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE)

* A __C++17 Finite Element Solver__ for modeling __Tsunami__ generation and propagation using the __Nonlinear 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE)__. 
---

### Overview

* __Tsunamis__ are Long-Wavelength, High-Energy Waves caused by underwater disturbances such as Earthquakes, Landslides, or Volcanic Eruptions.
* This project simulates __Tsunami Wave propagation__ in __coastal__ and __open-ocean__ settings using the __2D Nonlinear Shallow Water Equations__.
